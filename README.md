# _sketchPro_: Identifying top-k items based on probabilistic update

## Overview
_sketchPro_ is a novel sketch-based solution with a probabilistic update scheme, which can identify top-k items precisely with low memory consumption.

In order to adapt to the expansion of network scale and the massive increase in traffic, it poses challenges to the memory of both the server and the programmable data plane. For this reason, we propose sketchPro, which aims to achieve high-precision top-ùëò items detection with less memory.

The code is written by P4_16 running in programmable software switches (i.e., BMv2).
